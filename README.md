# My JavaScript Notes

#### NOTE: **I have made these notes while following the Harshit Vashisth Course on Youtube.**

So this consists of four folders, The first three folders that you need to go through, i.e., **_basics_**, **_local-storage_**, and **_asynchronous_**, contains the notes for basic JavaScript syntax. And the fourth folder named **_dom-manipulation_** contains a little advance things such as Event Bubbling and DOM manipulation.

You need to follow these notes in the correct order, first you should go through the **basics** folder. In this folder, it has a index.html file, you can open it in your browser to see the messages in your browser's _console_ while going through the notes. In the index.html file, all the JS files are connected in order. So to start with, first You need to **Uncomment** the first file and let other files stay commented. And then after going through that, now you need to uncomment the next JS file linked with index.html.

So, the order of folders in which you need to go through the notes is:

1. first **_basics_** folder
2. then go through **_local-storage_** folder
3. then **_asynchronous_** folder
4. then at last **_dom-manipulation_** folder
